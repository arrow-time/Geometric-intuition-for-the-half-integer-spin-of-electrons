# Geometric Intuition for the half integer spin of electrons

It is imaginable that the spin axis of an electron undergoes a flipping motion, with the flipping period synchronized with the spin period. This would allow for a 4π reset, while also providing a geometric intuition for the SU(2) double covering of SO(3). In fact, this combination of spin and axis-flipping corresponds to the mechanism required to explain the spherically symmetric and divergent electric field of the electron.

SU(2) double covers SO(3), meaning that the double covering is a homomorphism where the preimage set contains twice as many elements as the image set. My intuitive understanding of this is in terms of a "double rotational degree of freedom". This double rotational freedom could be interpreted as a combination of spin and axis rotation. How can a 4π reset be realized? When the spin period and the axis-flipping period are synchronized, a reset after two flips of the axis corresponds precisely to a 4π spin reset.

This geometric intuition is consistent with the observed physical phenomena.
